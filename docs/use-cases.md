3. User enters task title (required), description (optional), priority level
4. User selects target column for the task
5. User clicks "Create" or presses Enter
6. System validates input and creates task
7. Task appears in selected column with smooth animation

**Alternative Flow**:
- Validation fails: System shows error message and highlights problematic fields
- User cancels: Modal closes without creating task

**Postcondition**: New task is visible on the board and saved to local storage

### UC-03: Move Task Between Columns

**Precondition**: At least one task exists on the board
**Main Flow**:
1. User initiates drag on a task card
2. System provides visual feedback (card becomes semi-transparent, cursor changes)
3. User drags task over target column
4. System highlights valid drop zones
5. User releases task over target column
6. System moves task with smooth animation
7. Task status updates automatically based on column

**Alternative Flow**:
